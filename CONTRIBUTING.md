Publishing a new version

Creating a release branch

git checkout -b release-x.x.x
git push --set-upstream origin release-x.x.x
Note: x.x.x should be the next version not the current version.

Setting the version

cd projects/ngx-xapi
npm version x
Note: x should be replaced with either major, minor or patch. The npm version command will create and push a tag for the version.

Creating a GitHub Release

Next, create a GitHub release for the newly created version tag.

Once the GitHub release has been created, GitHub actions will publish the new version.

Merging the release branch into main

A pull request should then be created for the release branch to merge the changes back into main.

Note: Inorder to see the tag on the main branch, the changes should be merged back into main rather than squashed.
