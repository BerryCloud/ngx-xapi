# Samples

This directory contains sample code for ngx-api.

## Running the samples

To run the samples, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then build the library:

```bash
ng build ngx-api
```

Then run the sample:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can change the client configuration in `src/app/app.module.ts` to point to your own LRS.
